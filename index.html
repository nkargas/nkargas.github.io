      <h2><strong>About me</strong></h2>
      <p>
        I am a Ph.D. student in the
        <a href="http://www.ece.umn.edu/">Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</a>, at the
        <a href="http://twin-cities.umn.edu/">University of Minnesota</a> advised by Professor
        <a href="http://www.ece.umn.edu/~nikos/">Nikolaos D. Sidiropoulos</a>. My research interests are in the areas of <b>Machine learning</b>, <b>Statistics</b> and <b>(non-convex) Optimization</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A major focus of my work has been on <b>tensor methods</b> for machine learning with applications in <b>non-parametric density estimation</b> and <b>nonlinear function approximation</b>. Specifically, I have worked on the relation between tensors and multivariate statistics, providing conditions under which  joint distributions can be recovered from low-dimensional marginal distributions which is of interest when dealing with limited and/or missing data. More recently, I have been working on how tensor methods can be used as a tool for general nonlinear system identification.
      </p>
      <p>
        I received the Diploma and MSc degrees from the <a href="https://www.ece.tuc.gr/index.php?id=4481"> School of Electronic & Computer Engineering</a> at the <a href="https://www.tuc.gr/index.php?id=5397">Technical University of Crete</a>.
        As an undergraduate student, I was a member of the <a href="https://www.robocup.org/">RoboCup</a> team <a href="http://www.intelligence.tuc.gr/kouretes/web/">Kouretes</a> working on the team's localization module. Our team participated in research competitions held in Eindhoven, Netherlands and Tehran, Iran. As an MSc student, I was a member of the <a href="http://www.telecomlab.tuc.gr/Controller?event=SHOW_HOME">Telecom Lab</a> working on backscatter networks for large-scale environmental sensing.
